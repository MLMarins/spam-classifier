# Spam Classifier

In this project, I will be using Naive Bayes to create a model that can classify SMS as spam or not spam (ham).

The goal is to mimic our human ability to spot those messages using Naive Bayes. It’s a binary classification which means it’s spam or it is not spam.

The following project was provided by Udacity as part of their NLP course.

### Model

Naive Bayes algorithm applies probabilistic computation in a classification task. This algorithm falls under the Supervised Machine Learning algorithm, where we can train a set of data and label them according to their categories.
